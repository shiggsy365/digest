-- lib/bookshelf_opds_covers.lua
-- Disk cache for OPDS feed cover images, keyed by server + selected-URL hash.
-- A feed entry may carry both a full-size image link and a thumbnail link;
-- coverUrl below prefers the full-size image (thumbnails are typically only
-- ~100px, visibly soft on a high-DPI e-reader screen) and falls back to the
-- thumbnail when no image link is present. Fetching is a plain blocking loop
-- (CoverFetch.download per URL) run by the widget inside Trapper. Rendering
-- is NOT this module's job: a cached cover is exposed only as a PATH
-- (cachedPath below), which the repo attaches as book.cover_image_path --
-- the same external-cover mechanism Hardcover uses, rendered by SpineWidget
-- via ImageSource.loadImage (a cache-owned bb, never freed). This module
-- used to also hand back a decoded BlitBuffer (cachedCoverBB); that bb was
-- one-shot per the BIM convention, but the same OPDS record is painted
-- twice (grid cell + hero preview) and repainted on later network events, so
-- whichever widget painted first freed the bb out from under the other --
-- corruption on a real device. Removed rather than fixed: a one-shot-bb
-- factory sitting here just invites the same mistake again.

-- hashing or downloading a different URL than the one the gate checked would
-- reintroduce the cross-host credential leak that gate exists to prevent.

-- server. Unknown key (server deleted, filepath not ours) -> download
-- anonymously rather than error; that is exactly the pre-existing behaviour.

-- Credentials only travel to the server's own origin: the selected cover URL
-- came from the feed's XML, which a hostile or misconfigured server could

-- How long a cover-fetch pass may hold the main loop. This runs serially and
-- uncancellably off a scheduleIn, so the defaults matter: CoverFetch's
-- socketutil LARGE pair is 10s block / 30s total, which for a full page of
-- slots against a server that accepts the connection but never answers is
-- minutes of frozen shelf after an ordinary page turn. Two bounds instead:
-- a tight per-request timeout (a cover image is at most a few hundred KB -
-- anything slower than this is not going to arrive usefully), and a
-- whole-batch deadline so the freeze is bounded no matter how many covers
-- are missing. Whatever the budget cuts off is simply retried by the next
-- render of the same page, and the on-disk cache means each pass starts
-- where the last one stopped.

-- Nothing bounded this directory before: one full-size cover image per entry

-- accident -- the Cover tab's working-dir sweep, CoverApply.resetWorkingCache,
-- which owned the parent dir and recursed into this one. That now skips
-- opds/, which is why this needs a bound of its own: "cleared whenever the
-- user happens to close a book-detail modal" was never a policy.)
--
-- Deliberately dumb: total the files, and if they exceed the cap drop
-- oldest-by-mtime until they don't. mtime is "when it was downloaded", NOT
-- "when it was last looked at", so this evicts by age rather than by use --
-- a cover on a shelf the user opens daily is as evictable as one they saw
-- once. Slice 3 owns the real design (LRU on use, sharing the fetched_at
-- idiom the window store already carries); this exists so the dir cannot grow
