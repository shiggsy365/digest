-- entries to Bookshelf-shaped records. parse() vendors the normalisation
-- fixes from the stock plugin's opdsparser.lua (luxl is strict about

-- PRECEDING the page's book records (spec 6.2 nav-first): see nav_records
-- below.
--
-- Edition collapse: book entries sharing an exact (title, author) - both
-- non-nil - merge into one record within this single mapEntries call (one
-- feed page). The first entry wins id/filepath (stable keys: the record's
-- identity, and what the download mapping and the window's dedupe are keyed
-- on); every entry's acquisitions concatenate in feed order, so Gutenberg's
-- separate with-images/no-images entries for one work become one book
-- offering both formats. This is deliberately page-scoped: merging across
-- pages would need the whole feed in memory at once, so cross-page duplicates
-- are left to OpdsWindow's existing filepath dedupe instead (see appendPage).
--
-- Summary comes from the FULLEST edition - the merged entry with the most
-- acquisitions, ties going to the earlier one. Gutenberg lists the stripped

-- it. Only entries that actually carry a summary compete, so a fuller edition
-- with none never blanks the text a smaller one supplied.
--
-- Cover urls stay first-entry-wins, except that a later entry FILLS one the

-- placeholder, and a cover already chosen is never second-guessed.

-- which asks a server for the ONE format it may answer with. Servers that
-- only produce Atom (OPDS 1.x) are entitled to refuse that outright, and
-- strict frameworks do: Booklore/Grimmory (Spring) answers 406 "No acceptable
-- representation", so the catalog appears unreachable (issue #318). Every
-- OPDS 1.x-only server is in that class.
--
-- q-values keep the existing 2.0 preference exactly - measured against the
-- stock catalogs, Standard Ebooks and Internet Archive both still hand back
-- the same JSON they did before - while letting Atom-only servers answer, and
-- the */* tail catches servers that label their feed something unexpected.
--
-- Deliberately NOT Atom-first, even though the Atom path is the older and
-- more heavily tested of the two: a server offering BOTH would then switch
-- format (verified: Standard Ebooks flips to Atom), which is an unforced
-- change to catalogs that work today. Parsing never depended on this header
-- anyway - M.parse sniffs the payload - so widening it cannot change how a
-- response is read.
