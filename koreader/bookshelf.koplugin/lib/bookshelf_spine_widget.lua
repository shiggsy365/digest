-- Wraps an inner card widget in a "card with shadow" composition. The inner
-- widget paints at the slot's top-left (0,0); a ShadowRect of the same size
-- is wrapped in a FrameContainer with top+left padding equal to
-- SHADOW_OFFSET so it ends up at (offset, offset). The cover then paints on
-- top, leaving the shadow visible as an L-shape on the right and bottom edges.
--
-- Why this approach instead of nested Top/Bottom/Left/RightContainer:
--   * BottomContainer aligns its child to the bottom only when the child's
--     getSize().h < dimen.h. We had been wrapping a full-slot RightContainer
--     inside it, so the bottom-shift collapsed to zero — only horizontal
--     offset was visible.
--   * FrameContainer's padding directly shifts the inner widget's paint
--     position by exactly the padding amount — straightforward, no centering
--     surprises.
-- What read-status chrome this surface is entitled to.
--
--   show_progress -- the full grid treatment (bar, page-count pill, badges,
--                    fade). The series-number pill and the OPDS downloaded
--                    mark have their own show_progress gates elsewhere.
--   show_status   -- badges and fade only (list-view thumbnails, #365).
--   neither       -- the hero card, folder stacks and series stacks, which
--                    paint their own overlays and must stay clean.
--
-- decide() is asked once and the unwanted fields are zeroed, rather than
-- calling it twice with different arguments: it is the single source of
-- truth for how a status maps to chrome, and a second entry point would be
-- a second place for the on-hold cue rules (issue #121) to drift.
-- How far a list badge is pulled UP from where the grid would put it, so its
-- bottom edge clears the row.
--
-- The grid hangs its badges off the card and lets them overhang: the card has
-- room below it and the overhang is what makes a badge read as a mark ON the
-- book. A list card's bottom edge is the row's, so the same placement puts the
-- badge's last pixels on the divider -- on a PW5 the completed tickbox lost
-- its entire bottom border that way, which is what issue #365's follow-up
-- reported.
--
-- Taken off the BADGE'S OWN HEIGHT rather than off the cover. The obvious fix
-- is to anchor to where the artwork ends instead of where the card does, and
-- it does not work: the only cheap source for that is bookAspect's
-- cover_sizetag, which disagrees with what the renderer actually draws.
-- Measured on a PW5, Katabasis reports ~1.38 and renders at ~1.50, so an
-- artwork-derived anchor put the badge 19px too high and it stopped hanging
-- below the cover at all. The badge's height is a number we already have and
-- can trust, it scales with the Cover badge size dialog and with DPI, and the
-- overhang survives.
--
-- Deliberately SMALL. The grid's placement was very nearly right already --
-- the badge hung a few pixels past the cover and only its last row or two
-- were lost -- so this takes back just enough for the bottom border and its
-- halo, and leaves the rest of the overhang alone. Floored at 3px so it never
-- rounds down to less than the border plus halo it exists to rescue.

--     book can be painted twice per shelf render (a stack's representative
--     cover is also the hero's current book). So this path never reads
--     book.cover_bb; the embedded branch fetches its OWN fresh decode via
--     Repo.getCoverBB (allocates anew each call) and owns/frees that.
--   * ImageSource.loadImage returns a CACHE-OWNED bb ("callers must NOT
--     free it") -- so the external-cover branch must NOT free it and hands
--     it to ImageWidget with image_disposable=false. Freeing it corrupted
--     the ImageSource cache entry, so the NEXT read (swipe-back) got freed
--     memory -- which is why only the two Hardcover-cover books corrupted.
-- The plain cover_fill path above dodges all this only incidentally (its
-- ScaledCoverCache hit-branch serves an independent copy); this path skips
-- that cache (per-slot output size, not the cache's canonical size), so it
-- has to get ownership right by hand.
