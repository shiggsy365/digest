-- lib/bookshelf_opds_download.lua
-- OPDS acquisition download core: pick a destination directory, name the
-- file, and fetch it. Modelled on bookshelf_cover_fetch.download (User-Agent,
-- socketutil timeouts, pcall + unconditional timeout reset, tmp-then-rename
-- atomic write) and bookshelf_opds_feed.fetch ("auth" for 401/403), with the
-- timeout pair taken from the STOCK OPDS plugin instead of CoverFetch's --
-- see download() for why a cover's budget is the wrong one for a book.
--
-- Contracts this module deliberately does NOT own:
--   * Same-origin credential gating. download() sends whatever user/password
--     it is handed, unconditionally -- the caller (the OPDS widget) decides
--     whether the acquisition URL is same-origin with the server the
--     credentials belong to, exactly as bookshelf_opds_covers already does
--     for thumbnail fetches.
--   * Any UI. Every function here returns data or (nil, err[, extra]); no
--     dialogs, no Trapper, no progress reporting. The caller surfaces errors
--     (including turning "auth"/"downgrade" into a message the reader sees).

-- rankAcquisitions(acquisitions) -> ordered_list, recommended_index|nil
--
-- PURE (no I/O): reorders a record's acquisition links into the order worth
-- offering a KOReader user, and names the one to badge "recommended" -- but
-- only when the choice is unambiguous.
--
-- Why this and not the stock plugin's format labels. The stock OPDS browser
-- annotates formats with device-compatibility hints ("for older Kindles", "for
-- older E-readers"); on KOReader those are noise, because crengine opens
-- epub/mobi/azw3/fb2/pdf/djvu/cbz/txt natively. The format that reads best here
-- is EPUB (with images), so the ranking leads with it.
--
-- PRIMARY key is the MIME type, deliberately -- it is robust and i18n-safe,
-- where a link's human title is neither (Gutenberg writes "EPUB (no images)",
-- another catalogue writes it in French, a third not at all). MIME order:
-- epub, then fb2, then mobi, then pdf, then cbz, then djvu, then plain text,
-- then html. Unknown types sort last, keeping their feed order among
-- themselves.
--
-- SECONDARY key is a title tiebreak that only ever reorders WITHIN one MIME
-- group (MIME is compared first, so it can never move a format across groups):
-- a title matching /no%s*image/i sorts AFTER its siblings (an images-stripped
-- EPUB is the worse read), and a title containing "3" sorts BEFORE a plain one
-- (EPUB3 over EPUB). Fragile, Gutenberg-shaped heuristics, confined to breaking
-- ties so they can never drive the badge.
--
-- recommended_index is returned ONLY when confident, and nil whenever in doubt:
--   * the top item after ordering is application/epub+zip, AND
--   * its title does NOT match no-images, AND
--   * it is either the ONLY epub, or it strictly title-beats every epub sibling.
-- A single lone acquisition returns nil too: with no choice to make, a badge
-- says nothing. Everything else reorders without a badge.

-- claimDest(dest, map, filepath, acq) -> dest
--
-- Make sure `dest` doesn't belong to a DIFFERENT catalog record before the

--
-- util.getSafeFilename sanitises but does not uniquify, and filenameFor is
-- title + format, so two different records genuinely land on the same path:
-- two catalogues (or two entries in one) carrying the same book, or a
-- reprint under an identical title. Without this the second download
-- overwrites the first and BOTH opds_downloads keys then point at one file,
-- so record A's Open row launches record B's book -- silently, and with no
-- way for the read-side stat to notice (the file is right there).
--
-- map is the opds_downloads table (pseudo-path -> on-disk path); filepath is
-- the record being downloaded FOR. Only a value under a different key
-- counts: the same record downloading again -- the same acquisition, or the
-- other half of a collapsed edition pair -- is one book being replaced, which
-- is what the caller's overwrite prompt is for.
--
-- The disambiguator is a hash of the acquisition URL rather than a counter or
-- a title fragment: deterministic (so re-downloading the same acquisition
-- lands on the same file and still gets the plain overwrite prompt), and
-- collision-free without a retry loop (a title fragment would usually be
-- identical for exactly the records that collide). Reuses OpdsSource's djb2
-- so there is one hash in the plugin, not two.
--
-- Not defended against: a pathological title can push the SUFFIXED basename
-- past NAME_MAX. util.getSafeFilename truncates the stem to 240 bytes and
-- allows a 10-byte extension, so the plain path tops out at 255 exactly -- but
-- " (xxxxxxxx)" adds 11 more, and the ".tmp" the transfer writes first adds 4.
-- io.open then fails and the caller reports "Couldn't reach <server>", which is
-- the wrong diagnosis for the right refusal. It fails clean, and it needs both
-- a ~240-character title AND a genuine cross-record collision, so it is noted
-- here rather than worked around.

-- leaving TWO copies of one book on disk, which is the very complaint #336
-- reported. Reusing the recorded path keeps a re-download an overwrite.
--
-- Only the record's OWN entry is consulted (the map is keyed by OPDS
-- pseudo-path), so this can never resolve to another record's file. The
-- same-directory test keeps it strictly a naming-compatibility measure: a user
-- who has since changed their download folder gets the new folder, not an

--
-- Fetches url to dest_path atomically (tmp-then-rename,

-- bookshelf_cover_fetch.download with one difference: CoverFetch always
-- removes dest_path before renaming, which is fine for its disposable cache

-- is tried directly first (POSIX rename replaces an existing file
