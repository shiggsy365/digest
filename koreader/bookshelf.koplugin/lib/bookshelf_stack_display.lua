-- lib/bookshelf_stack_display.lua
-- How a GROUP tile draws itself: filesystem folders and every kind of
-- metadata stack (series, author, genre, collection, language, format,
-- rating).
--
-- SET PER CHIP, with one library-wide default. This started as one setting
-- per KIND ("folders look like folders, series look like a pile"), which read
-- well in the settings menu and answered the wrong question in practice:
--
--   * A chip IS a kind, so the per-kind rows were a second, parallel way of
--     saying what a chip shows - and the two could not be reconciled when a
--     library had two chips on the same kind wanting different tiles.
--   * An OPDS catalog's subcatalogs render as folder tiles, so they were
--     bound to the same row as the filesystem's folders. Wanting a catalog to
--     look different from your Documents folder was simply not expressible,
--     which is the bug that prompted this.
--   * The style is a property of the shelf you are looking at, so the place
--     to change it is the chip you are looking at - not a submenu three
--     levels into Settings that never mentions chips.
--
-- So: `group_display_default` is the library-wide style, and any chip may
-- override it (tab.group_display, persisted with the rest of the chip by
-- TabModel.save). Views that are not a chip - search results, which mix
-- folders, authors, series and genres in one list - take the default, because
-- there is no single chip whose opinion would apply.
--
-- SINCE LIST VIEW, a chip can also be pinned to covers or to a list outright.
-- That is a SEPARATE field (tab.view_mode, see lib/bookshelf_view_mode.lua)
-- shown as its own section of the same picker, not a value in this one. The two
-- were briefly merged and split back out on the maintainer's ruling: a chip
-- needs to be able to say "divider cards" without also asserting a view mode,
-- and "always a list" without discarding the tile style it would use if it ever
-- showed tiles again.
--
-- Two widgets render groups -- bookshelf_folder_stack (folders, OPDS nav
-- tiles) and bookshelf_series_stack (everything else) -- and they had
-- identical image ladders and identical cardboard overlays. Rather than
-- teach both the same five modes twice, both ask this module what to draw
-- and get back the same answers.
--
-- WHAT A MODE ACTUALLY CHANGES is only the "this is a group, not a book"
-- affordance. The cover underneath is chosen the same way in every mode
-- (custom image, else the group's first book, else a placeholder card);
-- the mode decides what is drawn OVER or AROUND it:
--
--   divider  the cardboard tab + name band. The shipped design, and the
--            default everywhere, so an untouched library is unchanged.
--   ribbon   a band across the lower third of the cover, name reversed out
--            of it, running slightly PAST both edges so it reads as a strap
--            around a bundle of books rather than a caption printed on one.
--   stack    the cover inset to the right, with spine outlines peeking out
--            behind it on the left. The pile IS the group cue, so no
--            cardboard.
--   collage  up to four member covers in a 2x2 grid.
--   text     no artwork at all: the placeholder card, group name as its
--            title. Chosen when the artwork is noise (a genre's "first
--            book cover" says nothing about the genre).
--   none     just the cover, with nothing over it. For kinds where the
--            first book's cover is a good enough emblem and the chrome is
--            clutter.
--
-- NO ROTATION. The "book stack" was described as a slightly rotated cover.
-- KOReader's blitbuffer rotates in 90-degree multiples only
-- (frontend/ui/widget/imagewidget.lua), and the cover-opening effect that
-- looks like a tilt is not one -- it is a banded trapezoid rescale blitted
-- straight to the framebuffer (BookshelfWidget.flexCoverOpen). An arbitrary
-- angle would have to be synthesised the same way, band by band, and at
-- tile size on e-ink that stair-steps. The pile here is built from offset
-- outlines instead, which needs no rotation and no per-paint bitmap work.

-- 2..N are bare { filepath } stubs -- so an earlier version used only covers the

-- halves of that were wrong on device: a two-cover collage stretched each cover
-- across half a tile, and the grid changing shape with the cache made the same
-- group look different from one visit to the next. A collage is a 2x2 grid; if
-- it cannot be filled, the empty cells are filled, not the layout redrawn.
--
-- The cost is real and deliberate: up to three extra BIM cover reads per
-- collage tile. It is bounded to the tiles actually on screen and to kinds the
-- user has explicitly set to Collage, and every fetched buffer is freed the
-- instant it has been blitted -- see the OOM note in the repository
