-- item-kind dispatch order (bookshelf_shelf_row.lua:448-670: explicit `kind`
-- first, then the legacy series shape detected by a `.books` array, then a
-- plain book), and the same reporting of the cover area actually rendered
-- into (bookshelf_shelf_row.lua:814-822) so the preloader warms next-page
-- covers at the size the row really used. The one difference: ShelfRow.new
-- takes an `items` ARRAY (a row of n_cols covers); ListRow.new takes a
-- single `item`, because a list row is one item. The caller (Task 6) builds
-- N of them.

-- ── The row's type and height: the chip bar's shape, on its OWN key ────────
--
-- A row measures like a chip -- same face, same base size, same painted band,
-- same arithmetic (BandMetrics, which both surfaces go through). What it no
-- longer shares is the SETTING: list rows are driven by list_font_scale and
-- the chip strip by chip_font_scale, so the two can be tuned independently.
-- At the default 100 on both they render identically, which is the point:
-- nobody sees a change until they nudge one.
--
-- Why the row's height moves with its font scale rather than staying fixed:
-- nudging the list scale is meant to be a DENSITY control -- fewer, larger
-- rows or more, smaller ones -- not a text-size control that grows type inside
-- a band that cannot hold it.
--
-- NOT the same WEIGHT as a chip, and that is a ruling rather than an
-- oversight. Chip labels are bold -- _buildLabelContent asks for
-- `{ bold = <segment is text> }` (bookshelf_chip_bar.lua:114 and :148), so
-- every non-icon run of a chip label renders bold, and the breadcrumb pills
-- say so outright at :966. Rows are not. Measured on a Paperwhite 5 capture
-- the two are already the same SIZE -- cap height 19px for both,
-- "HOME"/"SERIES" in the strip against "Dan Simmons" in a row -- and the whole
-- of the apparent difference was stem weight, 4px against 2-3px. Bold on 26
-- rows of a table reads as a page of headings, so the maintainer's call is
-- size and height yes, weight no.
--
-- The scale is read on demand rather than at load: it is a live setting and
-- the nudge dialog has to take effect on the next rebuild without a restart --
-- the same reason bookshelf_chip_bar.lua reads its own that way. The widget's
-- row-height budget (BookshelfWidget:_listRowHeight) goes through the same
-- lineStyles below that the render does, so the space reserved for a row and
-- the text it has to hold cannot drift apart: clipped descenders if the budget
-- is short, dead space in every row if it is long.
--
-- The row's DEFAULT face, for a line that names no family of its own.
ListRow.FONT_FACE = ListGeom.FONT_FACE

-- ── A line's own face ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Each line carries a point size and, optionally, a font family. The size is
-- declared BEFORE list_font_scale and multiplied by it here -- exactly the way
-- the hero multiplies a region's font_size by its own global scale knob. That
-- is what keeps list_font_scale a DENSITY control: nudge it and the type and
-- the band it sits in move together, rather than the type growing inside a
-- band that cannot hold it.
--
-- At the shipped defaults (16 and 14 at scale 100) this reproduces the sizes
-- the two-row column model rendered at, to the point.

-- ListRow.lineFontSize(line) -> the point size this line renders at.
-- ListRow.lineFontSize(line, scale_pct) -> the point size this line renders at.
--
-- scale_pct overrides the reader's list_font_scale, and has exactly one
-- caller: the DEFAULT row count, which is measured at 100 so that it is a
-- property of the configured lines and not of the type size.
--
--     "it should now control the size of text lines within the rows without
--      changing the row height"

-- user deletes a font file a saved line still names.
--
-- The bold flag comes back from BFont:getFace for the default face because a

-- ListRow.templateFont(template) -> the family a [font=NAME] tag names, or nil.
--
-- ONLY for a WRAPPING line now. A {xN} line renders through TextBoxWidget,
-- which lays a paragraph out in exactly one face, so a font tag anywhere in
-- such a template takes the whole box -- first tag wins, face only, mid-line
-- spans impossible by construction.
--
-- A single line no longer comes through here at all: its font tags are inline
-- runs (bookshelf_inline_style.lua), so "%title[font=Jost]x[/font]" styles the

-- line to Jost. A template that wraps its ENTIRE line in one tag renders
-- identically either way, which is what makes the change safe.
--
-- READ OFF THE TEMPLATE, not off the expanded text. A face decides a line's
-- HEIGHT, the height decides the row's, and the row's is page-constant and
-- settled before any book has been expanded against it. Taking the tag from

-- reason is quantisation, not taste: an e-ink panel renders 16 levels, one
-- every 17 bytes, so 222 lands on 0xDD -- ONE step off paper out of fifteen,
-- on a rule one pixel tall. Midtones wash out further on e-ink than any
-- desktop render shows, so the byte has to be chosen with room to lose some.
-- 136 is eight steps off paper and lands exactly on a palette level, so a 1px
-- rule needs no dithering to reach it.
--
-- The ceiling on darkening, so the next round of this does not overshoot: the
-- rule must stay LIGHTER than the row's own secondary text (SECONDARY_INK
-- below, byte 85). A rule that out-weighs the type it separates has become a
-- border, which is the failure in the other direction.
--
-- Re-measure this if ROW_BG ever stops being paper-white. With the endpoints
-- as they stand the interpolation below is numerically identical to
-- Blitbuffer.gray(7/15), and someone will eventually notice that and
-- "simplify" it. The coincidence is the point of the exercise, not a
-- redundancy: the value is safe because the two endpoints are ATTACHED --
-- ROW_BG is the row FrameContainer's real `background` and ROW_FG a real
-- `fgcolor` on every text cell, so what this function reads is what the
-- surface paints. Move either endpoint and gray(7/15) stops being the answer
-- while the arithmetic below keeps giving the right one.
local DIVIDER_INK = 7/15

-- The divider colour, interpolated IN PAINTED SPACE between the row's own two
-- painted colours. Deliberately NOT computed from Blitbuffer.gray() and not
-- switched on night_mode:
--
--   * gray()'s argument is DARKNESS (ffi/blitbuffer.lua:2637 -- "0 is white,
--     1.0 is black", painting 255*(1-f)), so a value picked to look
--     extra-light paints near-white and the night inversion turns it into a
--     heavy dark line. This plugin has got that backwards on the stack-pile
--     borders more than once.
--   * Interpolating between two colours the surface ALREADY paints means no
--     inversion reasoning enters this file at all. Paper is painted 255 and
--     ink 0 in both modes, so the rule paints 136 in both: displayed that is
--     136-on-255 in day (a grey rule on white) and 119-on-0 in night (the
--     same rule on black). Same distance from the page either way, which is
--     what a rule has to be on a surface that inverts -- and it is why one
--     darkening fixed both modes, which is what the report of "feint in both"
--     predicted it would.
--
-- CoverProgress.resolvedColors().border is the obvious "resolved dark
-- endpoint" and was measured before being rejected: it paints 0 in day but
-- #FAFAFA = 250 in night, five levels off the paper it would sit on, so any
-- weighting toward paper puts the night rule at 254 -- invisible. shadowGray()
-- is closer (128 day / 217 night) but still asymmetric enough that one weight
-- cannot serve both. Painted bytes, not palette intuition; grey names that
-- sound different land ~8 levels apart and vanish on e-ink.

-- How far the text of every line BELOW THE FIRST travels from paper towards

-- Which lines are muted is a rule, not a per-line setting, and deliberately:
-- the first line is the item's subject and everything under it is a note about
-- that subject, whatever the user has put there. A per-line colour would be a
-- sixth field on a shape that is already the hero's, and the hero has no such
-- field either.
--
-- Two thirds, which on this surface's endpoints paints byte 85 -- exactly
-- Blitbuffer.COLOR_GRAY_5, which is this plugin's declared MUTED role
-- (lib/bookshelf_start_menu_modules.lua:42 names it, and the hero modules and
-- the module kit draw every heading, hint and attribution with it). So the
-- list's secondary line is the same grey as every other piece of secondary
-- text in the plugin; it is reached the way THIS surface has to reach a colour
-- rather than by naming the constant.
--
-- Why not name the constant. A row paints its own paper and its own ink and
-- relies on KOReader's night inversion to turn white-on-black into
-- black-on-white without knowing the mode exists (see ROW_BG / ROW_FG above).
-- Interpolating between the two colours the surface actually paints keeps that
-- property: 85-on-255 in day, 170-on-0 in night, the same distance from the
-- page either way. Blitbuffer.gray() is NOT usable here -- its argument is
-- darkness, so the intuitive value paints its own opposite; the divider
-- comment above has the full account.
--
-- The test pins the resulting byte against COLOR_GRAY_5, so if either endpoint
-- ever moves, the mismatch is a failure rather than a slow drift away from the
-- plugin's own palette.
--
-- If a device ignores TextWidget fgcolor (bookshelf_widget.lua:175 records
-- that some Kindles do, for the inverted case) the second line renders black.
-- That degrades to "smaller but not muted", which still reads as secondary --
-- neither half of the treatment is asked to do the job alone.

-- TOP.
--
-- The cell reserves the whole content box it is given; the thing inside it sits

-- and comes out SHORTER than the row it spans. A listing configured for one or

--

-- ── Sharing the row's height out between its lines ─────────────────────────
--
-- ListRow.packRow(record, L, group_templates) -> plan, or nil to lay the page
-- layout down unchanged.
--
-- THE ROW HEIGHT DOES NOT MOVE. Everything below reallocates the height
-- ListGeom.rowHeight already reserved; it never asks for a pixel more or
-- leaves one unspent. That is the whole difference between this and the
-- collapsing experiment that was built and reverted earlier on this branch --
-- "we need to keep the row count reliable - let's revert the collapsing".
-- A variable row height makes _viewSize content-dependent, and the page budget
-- has to reserve row height BEFORE the page's items are fetched, so it cannot
-- be. A variable SPLIT of a fixed height is invisible to every one of those
-- callers.
--
-- What it is for, in the maintainer's words: "if there are blank rows (like
-- can be seen here), the rows should all move up into the empty space, except
-- the last row that can stay at the bottom edge. Any rows that are truncated
-- should be allowed to fill the space." Three rules, and they are the three
-- steps below:
--
--   1. RELEASE. A line whose template expands to nothing gives up its whole
--      band and is not emitted at all -- the lines under it move up. A {xN}
--      line that wraps to fewer than N lines gives up the difference. (The
--      screenshot that prompted this: a {x2} title that fitted on one line,
--      with a visible hole under it, above a {x3} description ending in an
--      ellipsis.)
--   2. GRANT. A {xN} line whose text did NOT fit takes from the pool, in line
--      order, in whole rendered lines -- a part of a line buys nothing. This
--      is the truncated line "allowed to fill the space", and it means {xN} is
--      a RESERVATION rather than a ceiling: it fixes what the row costs, and
--      at render time a line may show more if its neighbours did not want it.
--   3. PARK. Whatever is still unspent goes immediately ABOVE the last line,
--      so the last line stays on the row's bottom edge. That is what keeps a
--      final %bar aligned across every row on the page instead of floating at
--      whatever height its own row's text happened to end at.
--
-- Returns nil for a single-line row, which is the configuration every pixel of
-- this file's one-line path is pinned against: nothing to share out, and no
-- reason to pay for the measuring pass.
--
-- COST, measured rather than assumed, because TextBoxWidget:init does not
-- merely split the text: it calls _updateLayout, which renders the visible
-- lines into a fresh blitbuffer the height of the box
-- (textboxwidget.lua:220, :850). A "just to measure it" box is therefore a
-- real render, not a cheap one, and building one per wrapping line per row on
-- top of the render doubled a description-heavy page -- 39ms to 79ms on three
-- rows. That is why ListGeom.shareBands takes a callback: it asks for each
-- elastic line ONCE, at the tallest height that line can be granted, and the
-- box that answered is the box that gets rendered.
--
-- The one case that still pays twice is a line that came in UNDER its offer:
-- the box measures the height it was built at, so a line offered room for four
-- and using one has to be rebuilt at one. That rebuild is bounded by the row's
-- own height -- it is re-laying out text that already fits in the row -- where
-- the case it buys off, a blurb that wraps to thirty lines, is not.
--
-- What that leaves, on the same three-row page (min of eight alternating
-- rounds, the mean was uselessly noisy): +23% on a {x2} title over a {x3}
-- description, +10% on a {x2} title alone, and -31% on a layout with lines
-- that expand to nothing -- those are dropped now, so the row builds fewer
-- widgets than it used to. Most of the +23% is not overhead at all: the
-- description is being shown at four lines instead of three, which is the
-- feature.
-- Can a box this wide carry the overflow ellipsis?
--
-- THE BACKSTOP, not the fix. TextBoxWidget re-makes an overflowing line at
-- `targeted_width - ellipsis_width` (textboxwidget.lua:879) and RAISES when
-- that is not strictly positive -- so a text column narrower than one ellipsis
-- glyph does not render badly, it takes KOReader down. It happened: a pinch to
-- list_font_scale 226 at two columns, where the cover had grown until 21px of
-- the row was left for text, and the raise came out through _draftRebuild.
--
-- ListGeom.ART_MAX_SHARE is the actual fix and keeps the column far clear of
-- this. The guard stays because the consequence is so out of proportion to the
-- cause: any future furniture that eats a row's width should cost a truncated
-- line, never the application.

-- cost in this file (a %description resolves a sidecar), and doing it twice
-- per line per row would double it. `opts.band_h` likewise overrides the
-- page-constant band, because what packRow hands out varies per row while
-- `line` is one shared table for the whole page and must never be written to.
-- And `opts.box` is the wrapping line's laid-out TextBoxWidget, which packRow
-- already has because measuring one and building one are the same operation.

    -- was too small a mark to find; the tinted band was rejected on screen --
    -- and had a bug the border does not: TextBoxWidget FILLS its own background
    -- (default white, textboxwidget.lua:50), so a {xN} wrapping line punched a
    -- white hole in the tint. A border touches no pixel the text owns.
    --
    -- Rounded to the COVER CARD's radius, not a radius of its own: "the same
    -- style/thickness we use for cover images". Two roundings on one screen
    -- read as two design languages.
    --
    -- The border is present in EVERY state and only changes colour -- drawn in
    -- the row's own paper when unselected, so it occupies the same pixels and
    -- is simply invisible. Toggling `bordersize` instead would resize the
    -- FrameContainer (its getSize includes the border) and shift every row on
    -- selection.
    --
    -- The opaque background is load-bearing even UNSELECTED: a row draws its
    -- own paper so a %spacer's elastic gap shows page white rather than
    -- whatever is behind it.
    --
    -- ONE SELECTION MARK PER ROW. A button row already carries the state on
    -- the card itself -- SpineWidget thickens its own border when is_selected,
    -- which is the cover grid's behaviour and the whole reason that widget was
    -- used -- so drawing the row's border too gave a tapped catalogue row two
    -- concentric outlines: the card's thick one with the row's hairline
