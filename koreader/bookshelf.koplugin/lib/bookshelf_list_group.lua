-- bookshelf_list_group.lua
-- How a FOLDER or a STACK renders in list mode, as opposed to a book.
--
-- ── WHY GROUPS ARE HARDCODED HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Every other part of the list model is the user's: how many lines, what is on
-- them, what they are set in. A group is the exception, on the maintainer's
-- ruling:
--
--     "Folders and stacks need to be presented differently to books, probably
--      something we'd hardcoded - let's start by just putting a chevron icon
--      in the cover column, the folder title, then 'x Books' on the second
--      row"
--
-- The reason it has to be an exception rather than a preference is that a
-- template written for books says nothing useful about a folder. "%authors ...
-- %book_pct of %page_count pages" against a folder is at best blank and at
-- worst a lie -- a folder has no author and no reading position. Under the
-- column model each column carried a second, group-shaped accessor to paper
-- over this; a template has no such thing, so the row substitutes its own
-- content instead.
--
-- What it does NOT substitute is the STYLE. Each hardcoded line borrows the
-- face, size, weight, case and alignment of the user's line in the same slot.
-- That is not politeness, it is a load-bearing invariant: the row-height budget
-- measures the user's lines, so a group row that set its own sizes would be a
-- different height from the book rows around it and the page would hold the
-- wrong number of items. Same styles in, same height out, by construction.
--
-- ── THE COUNT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
--     "the count should use the same settings that drive the numbers shown on
--      the badge in cover view mode ... just using the extra width available to
--      make it clear what the numbers are with text labels"
--
-- So this reads the same two settings the cover badge does and answers the same
-- question, in words rather than in the badge's compressed notation:
--
--     cover badge   list line
--     ×12           12 books
--     3/12          3 of 12 finished          (stack_count_badge_format)
--     3/12          3 of 12 selected          (selection, which outranks both)
--
-- Including the OFF case: stack_count_badge_mode decides whether folders,
-- groups, both or neither carry a count, and a user who turned the badge off
-- gets no count line either. That also keeps the cost honest -- a folder's
-- count needs a recursive walk, and nothing here pays for one unless the
-- setting asked for the number.

-- ── The cover cell ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

-- chevron(width, height, glyph_h) -> a widget filling that cell with a right

--
-- It is NOT a cover, and that is the point. A group's first book would give a

-- size in a table that is exactly the problem: one arbitrary member's artwork,
-- too small to recognise, is indistinguishable from a book row. The chevron
-- says "this opens into something", which is the one thing artwork cannot say.
--
-- It moved to the RIGHT-HAND END of the row once the deck arrived, on the
-- maintainer's ruling: "moved the chevron the right of the books, and left
-- aligned to help title/book count". Two things fall out of that. The row
-- reads name, count, then the books it holds, then the way in -- and with the
-- cover cell gone the group's text starts at the row's left edge instead of
-- indented to line up with book thumbnails, which is the clearest signal yet
-- that a folder is not a book. There it is sized against the first LINE
-- rather than the row, the way the bulk-select tick is: a disclosure arrow

-- ── The deck ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Up to four member covers, overlapping like a fanned hand of cards, filling
-- the space a folder row has and a book row has not.
--
--     "the folder/stack rows stick out as needing a lot of work ... use the
--      covers inside the folder, four of them like we have in the collage
--      cover, and stack them up on the right edge like a bunch of overlapping
--      cards"
--
-- WHY IT GOES ON THE RIGHT rather than in the cover cell. The cell is one
-- thumbnail wide -- a cover at the row's height is already as wide as the
-- column -- so a deck inside it would have to shrink every card to about a
-- third, and a 55px cover says nothing at all. The row's RIGHT-HAND side is
-- the space that is actually free: a group has two lines to say against a
-- book's four or five, so on the maintainer's layout there were 750 empty
-- pixels beside "Southern Reach / 4 books". The deck fills the emptiness that
-- made the row look broken, at full thumbnail size, and the chevron stays in
-- the cover cell saying "this opens into something" -- which artwork alone
-- does not say.
Group.DECK_MAX = 4

-- How many configured lines a row needs before a group with no covers gets the
-- fallback tile: "probably drop the card if only 1 or 2 lines for folders".
--
-- The tile exists to fill a TALL row that has nothing in it. A one- or
-- two-line listing is a compact table, its rows do not look empty, and a
-- cardboard card printed with a name the row's own first line already carries
-- is just clutter at that density. Stated in LINES rather than pixels because
-- that is the thing the reader chose; the pixel floor in Group.tile is a crash
-- guard underneath it, not a second opinion about taste.
Group.TILE_MIN_LINES = 3

-- Which end of the fan is on top. "left" puts the first member's cover nearest
-- the text and the rest trailing off towards the row's edge, which is the
-- reading order; "right" anchors the front card on the row edge and recedes
-- back towards the text. A module constant rather than a setting until it has
-- been looked at on a real panel -- see the note on UI surface minimalism.
Group.DECK_FRONT = "left"

-- How far each card sits from the one under it, as a fraction of a card's
-- width. 0.42 was the first try and read as a row of overlapping covers rather
-- than as a stack; 0.28 buries most of each card and leaves the front one
-- clearly the subject.
local DECK_STEP = 0.28

-- A deck needs room to be a deck. Below this the cards are too small to tell
-- apart and the row keeps the chevron alone -- a one-line list has a ~60px row
-- and four 40px-wide cards in it is a smear, not an illustration.
local DECK_MIN_H = 64

-- EVERY MEMBER IN ORDER, coverless ones included and drawn as bare cards.
-- Two other rules were tried on screen first and both looked worse:
--
--   * skip the coverless and deal the next member instead. A ten-book series
--     whose members BIM has not indexed yet then shows ONE card, which reads
--     as "one book in here" -- contradicted by the count line beside it.
--   * give the coverless SpineWidget's lettered placeholder, so each card
--     names its book. Only about 70px of each buried card is visible, and the
--     placeholder centres its text in the card it thinks it has, so what
--     actually renders is a white strip with the middle of one word in it.
--
-- Which is the general lesson about this fan: past the front card there is a
-- SLIVER, and only things that survive being sliced -- artwork, or a plain
-- bordered card -- are worth putting on one.

-- A GROUP'S INLINE MEMBERS ARE LIGHT RECORDS AND HAVE NO COVER FIELDS. That is
-- deliberate upstream and it caught this out: Repo.getTags / getSeriesGroups
-- hydrate every member with light metadata and upgrade only books[1] to a full
-- record, because "the stack visual only renders books[1]'s cover" -- holding a
-- decoded cover for every member of every group is what OOM-killed KOReader on
-- a 2000-book library. A light record has no has_cover and no
-- cover_image_path, and SpineWidget requires one of them
-- (bookshelf_spine_widget.lua:794), so the deck drew the front card's artwork
-- and three placeholders for books whose covers the maintainer could see
-- perfectly well one screen deeper.
--
-- So a member that has never been asked about gets a buildBookMeta here.
-- want_cover = false, which is what keeps the upstream reasoning intact: it
-- sets has_cover without decoding anything, and SpineWidget's own lazy path
-- (scaled-cover cache, then Repo.getCoverBB) fetches the artwork at render
-- time for the three cards that are actually on screen.

--
-- THE FALLBACK WHEN THERE IS NO DECK, on the maintainer's ruling: "render the
-- cover/card that we would have shown in folder view, on the right ... that
-- cover/card is what keeps everything aligned and looking good in other tabs
-- like series."
--
-- An OPDS subcatalogue is the case that needs it. Its members are on someone
-- else's server, so there is nothing to fan and nothing to count, and a
-- Project Gutenberg feed came out as three words in a 253px row. The slot on
-- the right is what every other group row has an object in; filling it with
-- the tile the cover grid would have drawn keeps the column of objects
-- unbroken, and costs no new design -- it is a widget that already exists and
-- already answers to the reader's folder-style setting.
--
-- WHICH TILE is the same choice bookshelf_shelf_row.lua makes, deliberately
-- read from there rather than invented here: a folder or a nav entry is a
-- FolderStack, everything else (series, author, genre, tag) is a SeriesStack.
-- An OPDS nav tile is forced to TEXT whatever the folder style says, for the
-- reason given at that call site -- a remote category has no artwork of its
-- own, so every image mode ends up borrowing a cover from whatever happened
-- to be cached inside it, which is usually the wrong picture and reads as a
-- bug rather than a choice.
--
-- opts.on_tap / on_hold are the ROW's handlers. Both tile widgets return true
-- from onTap unconditionally, so a tile with no handler would be a dead patch
-- of a row that is otherwise tappable everywhere.
-- The smallest slot a tile can be built in.
--
-- NOT a taste judgement -- a hard floor. FolderCard.build (which both tile
-- widgets end at) solves its label width as
-- `slot_w - SHADOW_OFFSET - 2 * Size.padding.large` and hands the result
-- straight to TextBoxWidget. Below that it goes NEGATIVE, and TextBoxWidget
-- raises "width must be strictly positive" from inside makeLine -- which is a
-- crash of the whole reader, not a bad-looking row.
--
-- Found by crashing a Paperwhite: a one-line preset pinned to a catalogue chip
-- gave a 69px row, so a 44px slot, against a requirement of about 92 --
-- `label_w_avail` came out at -6. The same arithmetic was reachable without
-- any preset at all, from a compact layout and a coverless folder.
