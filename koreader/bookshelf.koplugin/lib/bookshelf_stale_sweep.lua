-- bookshelf_stale_sweep.lua
-- One-shot scan of CoverBrowser's bookinfo_cache for rows whose on-disk
-- file no longer matches the cached (filesize, filemtime). Reasons a
-- mismatch shows up:
--   * Syncthing pushed a replacement EPUB after enricher rewrote it
--   * User overwrote a file on the laptop and re-synced
--   * Calibre re-exported a book at a new path-collision-prone name
-- BIM has NO automatic invalidation -- once a row is written, the cover
-- bytes + metadata it holds are frozen until something explicitly deletes
-- the row. This sweep is that "something" for the cross-device sync case.
--
-- Stale criterion: SIZE mismatch only. Size catches enricher rewrites
-- (see ebook-enricher epub_meta.write_meta, which os.utime's mtime back
-- to the original to keep Recently-Added ordering stable) and plain edits
-- alike -- both change the byte count. We do NOT compare mtime: on
-- sync-heavy devices it drifts without the content changing and produces
-- false-positive purges that trigger a re-extraction storm contending for
-- the bookinfo_cache lock (issue #103). See the size-only check below.
--
-- For each stale row we run the SAME purge as the user-initiated Refresh
-- metadata path: BIM:deleteBookInfo (drops the persistent row) plus
-- ScaledCoverCache:drop (kicks the in-memory copy that would otherwise
-- shadow the freshly re-extracted bytes). The next shelf render of the
-- book finds getBookInfo() returning nil and the existing
-- _kickOffMissingMetaExtraction path takes over -- text-only for off-
-- screen books, full cover_specs for visible ones.
--
-- Cost on a 200-book library: one SQLite SELECT (~5ms) + 200 lfs.attributes
-- calls (~50ms total). Well under a second on a Kindle. The actual
-- re-extraction is throttled by the existing visible-first kickoff and
-- doesn't add to startup latency.
