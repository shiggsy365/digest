-- ── The chip bar's sizing, which is also the row's ───────────────────────────
--
-- A list row is the same kind of thing as a chip: a full-width strip of one
-- line of text that you tap. The maintainer's ruling is that it should measure
-- like one -- same shape, same face, same base size, same rounding -- rather
-- than having a private hardcoded 16pt nobody can reach.
--
-- Same SHAPE, separate SETTING. The row is driven by list_font_scale and the
-- chip strip by chip_font_scale, both defaulting to 100, where the two render
-- identically. They were briefly the same key; the maintainer separated them
-- so the two surfaces can be tuned independently -- a user who wants a denser
-- table should not have to shrink the chips to get one.
--
-- What the chip bar declares:
--   height  Size.item.height_default at the scale, via
--           lib/bookshelf_band_metrics.lua (which is the ONLY place that
--           derivation is written; it used to be inlined at three call sites)
--   border  bookshelf_chip_bar.lua's _buildChipRow wraps the whole strip in
--           FrameContainer{ bordersize = Size.border.thin }, whose border is
--           painted OUTSIDE the height above (see CHIP_BORDER_DP)
--   font    bookshelf_chip_bar.lua: BFont:getFace("infofont", _scaled(16)),
--           where _scaled goes through the same file
--
-- All of it is reproduced below as pure functions of their inputs. ListGeom
-- cannot read Size or the settings store -- it is deliberately widget-free so
-- the row arithmetic is testable off-device -- so lib/bookshelf_band_metrics.lua
-- does those reads, binds them to a scale key, and calls in here for the
-- arithmetic. Every consumer goes through that pair, so there is one rounding
-- rule for both surfaces, not one per call site.
ListGeom.FONT_FACE = "infofont"

-- The chip bar's base font size, before any scale. Changing this here and not
-- in bookshelf_chip_bar.lua would make the row and the chip disagree at equal
-- scales, which is the thing this arithmetic exists to prevent.
ListGeom.FONT_SIZE_DP = 16

-- scalePercent(n, pct) -- a font scale applied, rounding exactly as every
-- chip-bar site rounds (floor(x + 0.5), not ceil, not math.floor(x)).
function ListGeom.scalePercent(n, pct)
    if type(n) ~= "number" then return 0 end
    if type(pct) ~= "number" then pct = 100 end
    return math.floor(n * pct / 100 + 0.5)
end

-- fontSize(pct) -- the point size a row renders at. Identical to the chip
-- strip's _scaled(16).
function ListGeom.fontSize(pct)
    local s = ListGeom.scalePercent(ListGeom.FONT_SIZE_DP, pct)
    if s < 1 then s = 1 end
    return s
end

-- SECONDARY_PCT -- how big the SECOND text line is, as a percentage of the
-- first. Not a setting, and deliberately not one: the second line carries the
-- author, the series, the page count -- information that is secondary to the
-- title by definition, not by preference -- and the List view submenu is at
-- the five rows the maintainer agreed to.
--
-- 85 rather than 80 or 90, chosen against renders rather than in the abstract:
--
--   * at the default list_font_scale of 100 the primary is 16pt, and 80 / 85 /
--     90 give 13 / 14 / 14pt. So the only choice the DEFAULT user ever sees is
--     13 against 14, and 13 is a step too far -- on a 600x800 Kindle the
--     secondary line loses a further pixel of rendered height at 13 and the
--     author starts to read as a caption rather than as part of the item.
--   * 85 and 90 agree at the default and diverge above it: at
--     list_font_scale 150 the primary is 24pt and the secondary is 20 (85) or
--     22 (90). 22 against 24 is not a distinction anyone can see across a
--     table, which would leave the SIZE half of "smaller and muted" doing no
--     work for exactly the users who turned the scale up.
--
-- So: the smallest proportion that does not change the default rendering, and
-- the largest that still reads as smaller when the scale is raised. The muted
-- colour (bookshelf_list_row.lua's secondaryColor) carries the rest of the
-- distinction; neither is asked to do the job alone.
ListGeom.SECONDARY_PCT = 85

-- secondaryFontSize(pct) -- the point size the SECOND line renders at, at the
-- same list_font_scale. Derived from the primary size rather than from
-- FONT_SIZE_DP directly, so the two lines cannot drift: whatever the primary
-- becomes, the secondary is that at SECONDARY_PCT, through the same rounding
-- rule every other size in this file uses.
function ListGeom.secondaryFontSize(pct)
    local s = ListGeom.scalePercent(ListGeom.fontSize(pct), ListGeom.SECONDARY_PCT)
    if s < 1 then s = 1 end
    return s
end

-- CHIP_BORDER_DP -- the chip strip's outer border, one side, pre-scale.
--
-- 0.5dp, i.e. exactly Size.border.thin, which is the `bordersize` on the
-- FrameContainer bookshelf_chip_bar.lua's _buildChipRow wraps the whole strip
-- in. A FrameContainer paints its border OUTSIDE the content it wraps, and the
-- chip cells inside are built at the strip's declared `height` -- so the band
-- the user actually sees is that height plus this border twice.
--
-- Measured rather than reasoned about, because ChipBar also overwrites its own
-- `self.dimen` with the un-bordered height, so nothing in the widget tree
-- reports the real footprint. On a 1248x1648 panel at dpi 200 a device
-- framebuffer capture and an offscreen render agree: the chip band's outer
-- rules sit 52px apart (full-width dark rows at y=95 and y=146 offscreen,
-- y=91 and y=142 on the maintainer's Paperwhite 5) while chip_h is 50.
-- Matching the row to 50 left it visibly 2px shy of the band beside it, which
-- is the "height doesn't seem to match the chip bar" the maintainer reported.
ListGeom.CHIP_BORDER_DP = 0.5

-- chipRowHeight(item_height_default, pct, strip_border) -- the chip strip's
-- PAINTED height, which is what a row has to match to look like one.
--
-- `item_height_default` is KOReader's Size.item.height_default, i.e.
-- Screen:scaleBySize(30); passed in rather than reproduced so the row tracks
-- whatever KOReader makes that, the same value the chip bar is built from.
-- `strip_border` is Size.border.thin (CHIP_BORDER_DP scaled), counted twice
-- for the top and bottom edges of the strip's outer frame; omitted it degrades
-- to the un-bordered height rather than raising.
function ListGeom.chipRowHeight(item_height_default, pct, strip_border)
    local h = ListGeom.scalePercent(item_height_default, pct)
             + 2 * (strip_border or 0)

    return h
end

-- TAP_TARGET_DP -- the ~9mm touch-target figure a list row is measured
-- AGAINST. It is not a floor and no longer used as one.
--
-- It was: rowHeight floored text-only rows at 42dp * scale, which produced the
-- inversion the chip-bar pass removes -- turning the Cover column OFF made
-- rows TALLER (84px/16 rows on a Paperwhite 5 against 49px/27 with covers on),
-- because only one of the two branches was floored. Now both branches are the
-- chip's height, and re-applying this figure over the top would undo the
-- change outright: 42dp is 84px where a chip is 50, and 126px against a stock
-- Paperwhite 5's 62. A floor that fires on every panel is not a floor.
--
-- Kept, and kept at 42, because the suite states in numbers how far the
-- shipped row sits from the usual guideline, and that trade is worth being
-- able to see. rowHeight's own degenerate guard is the >= 1 at the bottom of
-- it: the honest statement that a row cannot be zero pixels tall, and nothing
-- more.
ListGeom.TAP_TARGET_DP = 42

-- ROW_RING_DP -- the list row's selection-ring thickness, one side, pre-scale.
--
-- NOT SpineWidget.SELECTED_BORDER. That is 7px on a 1248x1648 panel, sized to
-- read around a small cover among many in the grid; reserved on all four sides
-- of a table row it would spend 14 of the row's pixels on a band that is
-- page-white whenever the row isn't selected. A row is a full-width rectangle,
-- so a thin box round it reads as clearly as a 7px box round a thumbnail.
--
-- 1dp, i.e. exactly Size.border.default, against the inter-row rule's 0.5dp.
-- That is half the DECLARED thickness, not half the rendered one: both go
-- through Screen:scaleBySize, which is ceil(px * scale), and ceil(x) is not
-- 2 * ceil(x/2) in general. On a 1248x1648 panel at 200dpi the ring lands on
-- 2px and the rule on 1px, but on a stock 600x800 Kindle both round up to 1px
-- and the two marks are the same thickness. The ring is still distinguishable
-- there -- it is a rectangle round the whole row where the rule is a single
-- line between two of them -- but "double the rule" is not a property this
-- file can promise, so it does not.
--
-- The ring's reserved band IS part of the row's vertical padding when the text
-- is what sets the height: the content box sits inside it and the ring paints
-- into it when selected, so selecting a row changes only the perimeter pixels
-- and never moves a pixel of its content -- the same invariant SpineWidget's
-- own selection ring keeps, at a fraction of the cost.
ListGeom.ROW_RING_DP = 1

-- ROW_INNER_PAD_DP -- breathing room between the row's border and its content,
-- one side, pre-scale.
--
-- Reserved ALWAYS, like the ring, so nothing moves when a row is selected.
--
-- It exists because the selection mark became a box again and a box needs air:
-- the first ring sat hard against the text and read as a cramped rectangle,
-- which is half of why it was rejected. The maintainer's ask, third time round:
-- "can we add more padding inside each row, and try a round edge border around
-- the entire row".
--
-- IT COSTS ROWS, and how many depends on the geometry -- so do not assume
-- either way. rowHeight takes max(chip_h, line1 + 2*inset) before adding the
-- lines below, so the inset is free only while the first line plus the inset
-- still fits inside the chip band. Measured across the four calibrated
-- geometries, one-line rows: 52 -> 61 on a PW5 at dpi 200, 48 -> 59 on a PW3,
-- 34 -> 44 on a 600x800 Kindle, 67 -> 79 stock. So it is NOT absorbed at the
-- default sizes on any of them; an early reading of one two-line render at
-- dpi 264 suggested it was, and that render was the exception rather than the
-- rule.
--
-- Halving the band's reserved margin (see _listBandPlan's base_top_pad) was
-- done in the same pass and buys most of it back.
--
-- Declared here rather than sprinkled as Size.padding at the call site because
-- the row-height budget and the renderer both have to inset by the same amount:
-- a second opinion about it is how the row and its contents come to disagree.
ListGeom.ROW_INNER_PAD_DP = 2

-- ROW_GAP_DP -- the vertical gap between two list rows, pre-scale.
--
-- A hairline, not the PAD the cover grid uses between shelves. Covers need PAD
-- because a shelf row is a block of art that has to read as separate from the
-- one below it; list rows are a table, and a table's rows are separated by a
-- rule, not by a 37px band.
--
-- 0.5dp, i.e. exactly Size.line.thin -- the plugin's established hairline, and
-- the height ListRow.divider paints. The gap IS the divider, so there is no
-- whitespace to account for on top of it, which is what keeps the row-count
-- arithmetic (n * (row_h + gap)) honest. Both the divider and the row-count
-- budget read this one number, so they cannot drift.
ListGeom.ROW_GAP_DP = 0.5

-- INTRA_LEAD_DP -- the leading BETWEEN two adjacent text lines of ONE item,
-- pre-scale, measured from the bottom of the upper line's trimmed box to the
-- top of the lower one's. Paid once per gap, so an n-line item pays it n-1
-- times.
--
-- Small on purpose, and much smaller than the gap between two ITEMS: the lines
-- have to read as one thing with more said under it, not as separate rows that
-- happen to be adjacent. What separates two items is ROW_GAP's rule plus the
-- ring reservation at each end plus each item's own top/bottom padding; what
-- separates two lines inside one item is this and nothing else.
--
-- 1dp rather than 0. Zero is the tightest honest setting -- the lines set
-- solid, separated only by the leading the face itself carries -- but the
-- trimmed boxes below cancel TextWidget's own vertical padding, which is what
-- normally absorbs a fallback glyph that overruns its nominal metrics (a
-- diacritic, a CJK fallback face). 1dp is a cushion for that overrun which is
-- still invisible as leading: it scales to 2px on a Paperwhite 5 and 1px on a
-- stock 600x800 Kindle, against a box-level inter-item gap of 16px and 11px on
-- those same two panels (the whole table is in
-- .superpowers/.../shots/lead_table.lua, and the ratio is asserted per panel
-- in tests/_test_list_geom.lua).
ListGeom.INTRA_LEAD_DP = 1

-- Book cover aspect. true_cover_aspect is deliberately NOT consulted:
-- variable-width thumbnails would give the table a ragged left edge, which
-- costs more than uncropped covers gain at thumbnail size.
local COVER_ASPECT = 1.5

-- No hasCover() here any more. It used to walk the active column set looking
-- for an id of "cover"; there are no columns now, and the cover is the
-- list_show_cover boolean, so the answer is Lines.layout().show_cover and a
-- helper that re-derives it from a list would be a second, weaker source of
-- truth for a plain flag. See bookshelf_list_lines.lua's header.

-- rowHeight{ chip_h, line_heights, ring, text_pad, lead } -> pixels
--   chip_h        the chip strip's painted height (ListGeom.chipRowHeight)
--   line_heights  rendered height of EACH text line in the item, in order.
--                 One entry for a one-line row, N for an N-line one. Each is
--                 measured at that line's own face and size, so a row whose
--                 second line is bigger than its first costs what it really
--                 costs.
--   ring          selection-ring reservation, one side (ROW_RING_DP, scaled)
--
-- THE BAND sets the height. A row and a chip are the same gesture target and
-- measure the same at equal scales, so the tap the user learns on the chip
-- strip is the tap they get in the table -- and list_font_scale moves the row
-- as a whole, height and type together, which is what makes it a density
-- control rather than only a text-size one.
--
-- No has_cover branch, and that is the point of the change rather than a
-- simplification of it. Two branches meant the cover-off case was governed by
-- a 42dp floor while the cover-on case was governed by the text, so turning
-- the Cover column OFF made rows TALLER -- 84px and 16 rows on a Paperwhite 5
-- against 49px and 27 with covers on. One expression cannot invert.
--
-- The max() is the text's veto, and it is NOT a formality: 30dp of band and a
-- 16pt line are close enough together that which one wins depends on the
-- panel. Measured across the seven sweep baselines at scale 100, the band
-- binds on six and the rendered line binds on ONE -- a 600x800 Kindle at dpi
-- 167, 34px of text against a 33px band. There the row comes out a pixel
-- TALLER than a chip, which is the harmless direction; a row one pixel SHORTER
-- than its own line clips descenders in every row on the page. Both terms
-- scale with list_font_scale together, so the relationship holds across the
-- 50-300 range the nudge dialog offers. Which term binds where is pinned in
-- tests/_test_list_geom.lua rather than left to this comment to keep true.
--
-- Earlier models, named so none of them comes back: font_h * 2.4 spent ~40% of
-- every row on padding and left list mode LESS dense than the cover grid it
-- exists as an alternative to (9 rows against 12 books on a 1248x1648 panel).
-- A fixed 44dp cover bought 14 rows, still only two more than the grid.
-- Text-tight got 27, and the band keeps nearly all of it while buying back the
-- tap target and the user control: measured at scale 100, ONE of the seven
-- baselines keeps exactly the row count it had and the other six lose between
-- one and three. Both figures are asserted in the test file.
--
-- On the tap target: a stock Paperwhite 5 row is 66px, which on its 300ppi
-- panel is 5.6mm against the ~9mm usually quoted -- but it is precisely the
-- chip strip's own target on that device, so the two surfaces are not asking
-- the thumb for different things, and a user who wants more can now say so
-- without shrinking the chips. Excel density and a 9mm target are not both
-- achievable on these screens; the mitigation is that in collapsed list mode a
-- tap PREVIEWS rather than opens (double tap opens), so a mis-tap costs a
-- preview rather than the wrong book. See TAP_TARGET_DP.
--
-- The density premise -- a list shows MORE books than the cover grid -- is
-- true at the default scale on every baseline and is NOT scale-free: the grid
-- does not move with list_font_scale, so a large enough row loses to it. Where
-- that crossover sits per panel is measured and pinned in
-- tests/_test_list_geom.lua; it is a real ceiling, not a bug, and the suite
-- states it rather than this comment.
--
-- EVERY LINE AFTER THE FIRST costs its own line box, LESS the padding that box
-- is carrying twice over, PLUS the declared leading. Written as
--
--     rowHeight(n lines) = rowHeight(1 line) + Σ secondLineCost(line i)
--
-- so that at one line the expression is byte for byte what it was before more
-- than one was possible: a single-line list cannot move by a pixel, whatever
-- happens to the arithmetic for the lines below it. The sum is over an ARRAY
-- because the count is a user setting now -- one line, two, or six -- and
-- because each line carries its own font size, so they are not interchangeable
-- terms.
--
-- WHY THE SUBTRACTION. A KOReader TextWidget is not the height of its text: it
-- is `ceil(face_height) + 2 * padding`, where padding defaults to
-- Size.padding.small (ui/widget/textwidget.lua:113, and the default at :34).
-- That padding is decoration -- it exists so a fallback glyph that overruns
-- the face's nominal metrics does not touch whatever sits above or below --
-- and every line carries it on BOTH sides. Stack two such boxes and the pair
-- is paid twice between the lines, on top of the internal leading the face
-- already has. On a Paperwhite 5 that is 8px of it. Measured off a render at
-- that panel, glyph extent to glyph extent, the white INSIDE an item came to
-- 19-25px and the white BETWEEN two items to 24-30px -- two ranges that
-- overlap, which is exactly why the pair read as two rows rather than as one
-- book. Trimmed, the same items measure 10-17px inside against 25-30px
-- between: ranges that no longer meet.
--
-- So a second line costs `line2_h - 2 * text_pad + lead`: its own box with the
-- doubled decoration cancelled, plus the leading this file declares. The
-- renderer (bookshelf_list_row.lua) trims the same 2 * text_pad off both boxes
-- and gives the item back a symmetric top/bottom padding out of the band, so
-- the sum here and the layout there are the same arithmetic.
--
-- Doubling the band instead (max(chip_h * lines, ...)) would have spent a
-- whole row's worth of whitespace per item on a surface whose entire point is
-- density.
--
--   text_pad  TextWidget's own vertical padding, ONE side. Passed in rather

-- ── WHICH lines a row can afford ───────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- fillRow, below, divides a row's height between the lines that are IN the
-- layout. This decides which those are, and it exists because the row height
-- stopped being derived from the lines.
--
-- Under the density model the row was as tall as its lines needed, so every
-- line always fitted by construction and font scale was the only way to change
-- how many rows were on screen. That conflated two separate things a reader
-- wants -- "big enough to read" and "how much on a page" -- and the maintainer
-- hit it: "increasing or decreasing the rows can make the font too small or
-- too large, these controls should be separate."
--
-- So the row height is now the READER'S, taken from the row count, and the
-- content adapts to it. What gives, in the maintainer's own sequence for a
-- five-line layout as the space shrinks:
--
--     12345  ->  1235  ->  125  ->  15  ->  1
--
-- Read off that: the FIRST line is kept longest, the LAST line is kept second
-- longest, and the middle collapses from the bottom up. Which inverts to a
-- keep-priority of 1, N, 2, 3 ... N-1 -- and the last line's standing is not
-- arbitrary, it is the same one the allocator gives it by parking the
-- row's slack ABOVE it so a closing %bar keeps the bottom edge.
--
-- ELASTIC LINES SHRINK BEFORE ANYTHING DROPS. A {x3} description with room for
-- one line should show one line, not vanish, so every {xN} is walked down
-- toward a single rendered line -- least important first -- before the first
-- whole line is given up. That is also what {xN} now MEANS: "up to N lines if
-- there is room", where it used to reserve N and make the row taller. The row
-- cannot be made taller any more; that is the reader's number.
--
-- PAGE-CONSTANT, and this is the property that makes it cheap. Both inputs --

--
-- Whether a line carrying %spacer may WRAP, and how wide its left side gets.
--
-- These lines used to be single-line by rule: %spacer asks for a left and a
-- right half, which reads as a one-line idea, so the measure callback handed
-- one line back and the left side truncated. The rule met the DEFAULT list
-- template -- "%title %spacer %rating %favourite" -- and produced a truncated
-- title with a row of empty space beneath it, which is what a reader reports
-- as a bug rather than as a design.
--
-- The plan reserves the right-hand tail on EVERY line and wraps the left into
-- what is left, putting the tail on the first line. The alternative was to
-- wrap at full width and rebuild the last line with the tail beside it, which
-- means slicing a TextBoxWidget at its own wrapped-line boundaries -- reading
-- vertical_string_list, which has already caused one bug in this file's
-- neighbourhood, and which xtext shaping makes worse for CJK.
--
-- Two guards, both of which fall back to the old single truncated line:
--
--   * offer < unit * 2 -- the row has room for one line, so there is nothing
--     to wrap into. Same test the non-elastic path already applies.
--   * box_w < inner_w * MIN_BOX_FRAC -- reserving the tail costs width on
--     every line, and past a point the trade stops paying: a title wrapped
--     into a sliver reads worse than a truncated one. Half the column is the
--     floor, and it is a floor rather than a target -- exactly half still
--     wraps.
--
-- %bar is not a caller. A bar is a graphic with text either side, so one line
-- is the whole idea of it.

--
-- WALK THE LINES IN ORDER, EACH TAKES WHAT IT NEEDS. Every line is offered
-- everything still unspent and reports back; when the height runs out the
-- rest are not emitted. No line declares a size in advance -- {xN} is gone,
-- and this is why:
--
--     "the available space is determined by the row number setting, not the
--      number of text lines ... similar in nature to the hero area, where the
--      lines are set without any special wrapping rules. the heading expands
--      first, and the description fills the remaining space."
--
-- ROWS LOSE LINES FROM THE BOTTOM UP. The first design anchored the last
-- line so a closing %bar always survived (12345 -> 1235 -> 125 -> 15 -> 1),
-- but on screen that dropped the AUTHOR before the progress bar, which the
-- maintainer ruled looks odd -- so the ladder is now simply document order:
-- 12345 -> 1234 -> 123 -> 12 -> 1. A long title still expands first and
-- pushes the bottom lines out, bottom-up.
--
-- WRAPPING YIELDS TO THE LINES BELOW -- except line 1. On screen, a blurb
-- that wrapped to two lines while the progress bar fell off the row read as
-- the bar "yielding to the description", and the maintainer ruled it should
-- not: a line after the first may only WRAP into space left over once every
-- line below it has been offered one line of its own. Drops are still
-- bottom-up (the reservation yields when the row cannot hold one line of
-- everything); what changed is that expansion never causes a drop. Line 1
-- keeps its original privilege -- "the heading expands first" -- because a
-- truncated title hurts more than a dropped bar.
--
-- AND THE WALK STOPS at the first line that does not fit. Skipping it and
-- letting a shorter line below squeeze in would re-create the very hole this
-- reversal removes: a row showing line 1 and line 4 with 2 and 3 missing. A
-- line with NOTHING TO SAY is different -- it costs no height and does not
-- block the lines below it (a group row fills only the first two).
--
-- PER ROW, not per page, and that is a deliberate reversal. The earlier design
-- decided the surviving set once for the page so every row showed the same
-- lines; the maintainer chose content-driven instead -- "If there's space for
-- 3 lines 125 but one book has a longer title in line 1, we'd get 115". Rows
-- stay the same HEIGHT either way, so the page keeps its rhythm; what varies
-- is what fills them.
--
-- ONE MEASURE PER LINE, which is the whole reason for the callback. Asking
-- every line how tall it would like to be and then building it again at the
-- height it got means laying out each one TWICE, and a TextBoxWidget's init is
-- a real render, not a probe (textboxwidget.lua:220) -- that pattern took a
-- three-row description page from 39ms to 79ms. Here each line is measured
-- once, at the largest height it could possibly be granted, and the widget
-- that answered is the widget that gets drawn.
--
-- Returns bands[i] = nil for a line that was not emitted, plus ONE of
-- extra_lead (inserted above the last line, so it keeps the row's bottom edge)
-- or extra_bottom (below everything). Which one depends on the last CONFIGURED
-- line rather than the last survivor: a group row borrows the user's styles
-- but fills only the first two, so pinning the last SURVIVOR pushed "1 book"
-- to the bottom of the row with a hole above it.

-- inside the ring reservation, at the book aspect, with nothing else taken off
-- it. Takes the ROW height rather than the content height so that every
-- caller -- the row itself, and the two BIM/preload sites that warm covers
-- before a row exists -- subtracts the ring exactly once, here. Passing the
-- row height and forgetting the ring is how the preloader came to warm 88px
-- covers for a 74px thumbnail; there is now no signature that lets it.
-- ── The art budget ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- The most of a row's width that PICTURES may take: the cover cell, or a
-- group's deck of member covers plus its chevron. Whatever is left is the text
-- column's, and it has to be left something.
--
-- Why a cap exists at all: artwork is sized from the row HEIGHT, which knows
-- nothing about how wide the row is. In a multi-column list a tall row is a
-- NARROW one, so pinching the rows taller grew the cover until the text column
-- had less room than a single ellipsis glyph -- and TextBoxWidget raises on
-- that (`makeLine (width must be strictly positive)`, textboxwidget.lua:879,
-- where it re-makes a line at targeted_width - ellipsis_width). An uncaught
-- raise inside a draft regrid takes KOReader down with it, which is what
-- happened on the PW5 at two columns and list_font_scale 226.
--
-- A HALF, rather than something tighter: the cap has to fix the crash without
-- moving any layout that already reads well. Measured on a 1248x1648 panel,
-- the cover takes 13% of the row at one column and 28% at two, both at the
-- default scale, and three columns lands just under the line -- so nothing a
-- reader is looking at today moves, and the runaway is bounded five times
-- clear of the glyph that breaks it.

-- ── %bar{rel}: a bar as long as the book ───────────────────────────────────
--
-- A plain %bar fills the line: every book's bar is the same length and only
-- the fill differs, so 40% of a 900-page book looks exactly like 40% of a
-- novella. %bar{rel} scales the bar's TOTAL length by how long the book is, so
-- the filled part is comparable down the column -- which is the actual question
-- ("how much reading have I done here?") rather than the proportional one.
--
-- Requested as: "an option (perhaps via {rel} modifier) to show relative book
-- length for each book by adjusting the total length of the bar ... perhaps by
-- hardcoding an 'average' book length, and applying a percentage scale based on
-- how much above or below that the current book is? Maybe there's a better
-- way."
--
-- ── THE CURVE, AND WHY IT IS NOT LINEAR ────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Linear against a fixed average is the obvious answer and reads badly: real
-- libraries span 60-page novellas to 1200-page doorstops, so a linear scale
-- normalised on a typical novel either clips the top half of the range or
-- squashes everything typical into the left third of the row. Page counts are
-- roughly log-normal, and a square root is the cheap compression that matches:
-- it keeps the ordering exact, keeps typical books using most of the width, and
-- still makes a doorstop visibly a doorstop.
--
--   pages   fraction of the line
--     75    0.32
--    175    0.49
--    350    0.70   <- REFERENCE
--    700    0.99
--   1200    1.00   (capped)
--
-- The alternative considered and rejected: normalising against the longest book
-- on the CURRENT PAGE. That needs no constant and is self-calibrating, but the
-- scale then changes as you page -- the same book draws a different bar on page
-- 1 than on page 2 -- which makes the one thing the feature is for (comparing
-- down a column) unreliable across a scroll.
--
-- REFERENCE is a constant rather than a setting for now: it is the sort of
-- number that wants to be picked once by eye against a real library, and one
-- more nudge dialog nobody opens is worse than a good default.
