-- bookshelf_series_stack.lua
-- Renders a series/author/genre/tag slot: a single representative book
-- cover with a compact folder card below carrying the group's name, and
-- a count badge ("×N") on the cover's top-right edge to convey "this
-- represents N books".
--
-- The previous design rendered three diagonally-offset book covers
-- (Layer1/2/3) to imply "stack" plus a black series-name band. The
-- back layers were never visually distinguishable from the front
-- (small offsets, identical artwork in single-book series), and they
-- forced a defensive `safeCopy(bb)` of the cover bb to avoid a
-- use-after-free when three SpineWidgets shared one bb. Dropping
-- them removes both the per-paint copy and that whole class of bug.
--
-- The folder card matches FolderStack exactly via folder_card.lua.
-- The count badge is the only thing that distinguishes this widget
-- visually from FolderStack.
